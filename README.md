This is the source of my personal website. It was built using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), which is basically like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) only it uses VueJS instead of React. I was using [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) previously but that did not allow me to easily develop new features.

## How to run the project
### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Start developing

1. Clone this repo wherever you want
2. `cd <cloned-directory>` to open the folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
